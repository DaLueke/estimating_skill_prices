% What do I do in this thesis? 1-3 sentences. Top level description
This thesis presents a method to estimate changes in task specific skill prices. In a theoretical framework of continuous task choice, workers behave utility maximizing by optimally choosing in what tasks they engage under consideration of resulting wages and accompanying occupational amenities. The identification strategy presented in this thesis can be used to infer on changes in relative skill prices from observable wage changes in panel data. As a proof of concept, I test this theoretical result in a simulation study. Herein, simulated changes in skill prices are estimated accurately in a Monte Carlo estimation. This result contributes to the research on changes in wage structure and changing importance of occupational tasks.

% Next step: apply this method to real world panel data. 
%% Here it could be useful to estimate skill accumulation as well as a broader model of amenities in a more saturated model of personal traits (like Böhm et al propose in their appendix)
Applying the developed method to actual observation data could provide valuable insights into changes in labor demand at a task level. These insights could help to better understand the larger shifts in  labor demand that are summarized in the concept of job polarization. Such an application to panel data would, furthermore, provide the opportunity to refine the estimation method. In section \ref{sec:identifying-changes-in-skill-prices} I show that wage changes result as a composition of changes in task specific skill prices as well as skill accumulation and changes in amenities. The estimation of both, skill accumulation as well as changes in amenities could be refined using observable characteristics of a panel data set. Particularly, Böhm et al. (\citeyear{bohm2019occupation}) make use of a saturated skill model to estimate changes thereof as a result of occupational choices and observable characteristics controlling the speed of skill acquisition of a worker. In their online appendix, Böhm et al. (\citeyear{bohm2019occupation}) furthermore provide a method to estimate changes in the relative amenity value of occupational choices between periods and in comparison to a reference occupation. In a setting where the personal characteristics of workers allow an indication of the amenities experienced from their task choice, the authors present a method that enables an estimation of changes in amenities using workers' task choice and characteristics.
\\
With this model of continuous task choice at hand, an arbitrarily differentiated examination of changes in relevance of different occupational tasks for labor market outcomes in the sense of employment and wage growth is possible. In contrast to the discrete division into routine versus non-routine or cognitive versus manual tasks that is usually the basis in similar studies, the model allows for a continuous scale. This can potentially increase the precision of estimations of task prices by attributing wages to occupational tasks more accurately. Additionally, this framework allows to consider a larger number of occupational tasks and according skills in a comprehensive model.

% Identifying changes in skill prices could be helpful in understanding larger shifts in labor demand - similar to what e.g., Deming presents: What tasks experienced growing demand throughout recent years
% Policy implications: only by identifying what skills are favourable for economic outcomes (employablility and wage), they can be appropriately promoted
% One shortcoming of the model presented in this thesis is the neglected complementarity of tasks. The way wages are understood in this model does not allow for interactions in the valuation of task skills.
